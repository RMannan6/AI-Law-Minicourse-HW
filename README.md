# Step 1

# The code retrieves the URL address of http://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/years/ and downloads Supreme Court cases between 1716 and 2018. The code counts the number of cases and puts them in a table. The data is ready to be used for machine learning purposes.

# Step 2

# The code uses the same URL as in Step 1 and downloads all the cases into full_project. Then, the final step is to put full_project in your local folder. The data is has been processed.

# Step 3

# A stopword list is created and the program must now learn to remove the stopwords from the case load data that was processed in the previous step. 

# Step 4

# Here, the code uses a machine learning algorithm to output a topic model. 

# Step 5

# This step arranges the data for visualization.

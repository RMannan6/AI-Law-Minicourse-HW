# Step 1

# The code retrieves the URL address of http://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/years/ and downloads Supreme Court cases between 1716 and 2018. The code counts the number of cases and puts them in a table. The data is ready to be used for machine learning purposes.

# Step 2

# The code uses the same URL as in Step 1 and downloads all the cases into full_project. Then, the final step is to put full_project in your local folder. The data is has been processed.

# Step 3

# A stopword list is created and the program must now learn to remove the stopwords from the case load data that was processed in the previous step. 

# Step 4

# Here, the code uses a machine learning algorithm to output a topic model. Check to see how many words are in our data frame. Then, defining models to apply machine learning algorithms to. Test out each type of model. Apply LDA model. The features outputted from using LDA are not what we are looking for. Apply LSA model. This is more like what we want.

# Step 5

# This step arranges the data for visualization.

# Overall Experience
# I do not know a lot about coding, so the code looks confusing to me.  It is easier to go over the code step by step in class then going over it myself.
